# SYNTH_MAGLAND

## Synthetic groundtruth generated by spikeforest
- Data generated by James Jun on Oct 19, 2018 based on Jeremy Magland's code
- Waveform templates are generated using parameteric curves
- Spike timing was randomly generated from the Poisson distribution and white noise is added
- [Code is available on Github](https://github.com/magland/spikeforest/tree/master/working/gen_synth_datasets/8trode) (TODO: need to update this link)
  - run `python working/gen_synth_datasets/8trode/driver.py`
  - commit#: eaf42d7a76dfd31b4150b752815d8efffdc51908
- Required packages
  - [spikeinterface](https://github.com/colehurwitz31/spikeinterface)
  - [mountainlab_pytools](https://github.com/magland/mountainlab_pytools)

## Studies contained this dataset
- Directory names follow a format `datasets_noise#_K#_C#` where
- `noise#`: noise value added (SD of white noise, 10 or 20)
- `K#`: number of units simulated (10 or 20)
- `C#`: number of electrodes (4 or 8 channels)
