# SPF_HYBRID_JANELIA
- Hybrid recording with a sinusoidal probe drift
- Drift was generated using 2D interpolation (Modified Akima)
- Waveform templates were recorded using 5 um spaced electrodes, see [Kampff lab Ultradense Survey](http://www.kampff-lab.org/ultra-dense-survey), and later subsampled to match the Neuropixels electrode spacing
- Background noise was generated using ~1/f random noise that matches experimental neural recordings.
- Generated by `Kilosort2\eMouse_drift` [code available on Github] (https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2)
- Two sine wave periods were present in the drift (20 um amplitude) for the full recording duration (1200 s).

## Recording format
- int16 raw format (channels x time order)
- 1200s recording was divided to various length (600s, 1200s).
- 64 channels were divided to various sub channels (4, 16, 32, 64) at various probe locations.
