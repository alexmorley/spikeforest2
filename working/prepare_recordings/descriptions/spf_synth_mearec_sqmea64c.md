# SPF_SYNTH_MEAREC_TETRODE

## Recording
- Synthetic groundtruth generated by SpikeForest using spike waveform templates generated by MEAREC (neuron-based simulator)
- Recordings generated by James Jun on Dec 4, 2018
- code is available on Github
  - run `https://github.com/magland/spikeforest/blob/master/gen_synth_datasets_mearec/gen_synth_datasets.ipynb`
  - Python notebook is modified from `gen_synth_datasets.ipynb` written by Jeremy Magland
  - commit#: 6691a1b4701696fa6b9aab5294f34a53ebb9d65e
  - Spike waveform templates are generated by Alessio Buccino using MEAREC

## Electrode
- MEA, 8x8 square (15 um pitch)
- Original tempate had 10x10 layout, 8x8 square was extracted centered at the peak activity

## Directory naming convension: datasets_noise#_K#_C#
- noise#: noise value added (SD of white noise)
- K#: number of units simulated
- C#: number of electrodes (arranged linearly and separated by a 1 distance unit)
