# PAIRED_CRCNS_HC1
- Data download from [crcns.org website](http://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-1/about/?searchterm=download)
- Raw recordings were curated by James Jun 
- Intracellular timing was determined by threshold crossing of a differentiated intracellular trace (10 SNR).
- Stimulus artifacts were manually removed 

## Electrodes
- Mix of tetrodes or six-channel silicon probe (single shank was exported, edge electrodes arranged in a 'V' shape)
