# TEST_SAMPLERATE

## Synthetic groundtruth generated by spikeforest
- Data generated by James Jun on May 23, 2019 based on a simulated study (`synth_magland\datasets_noise20_K20_C8`)
- Sampling rate is varied from 30000 Samples/s to [15000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 60000]
- Resample is performed after FFT, padding, and IFFT.
- Low-pass filter was applied at the 80% of the nyquist sampling rate to produce smooth power transition with 1000 Hz width
- The dataset is generated using IronClust matlab script available on github
  - https://github.com/jamesjun/ironclust/tree/master/matlab/convert_mda/convert_mda_samplerate_
  - run `irc convert-mda-samplerate` after installing `IronClust`
- All recordings contain 20 ground-truth units, 8 channels, 600 s recording duration, and 20 uVrms noise
