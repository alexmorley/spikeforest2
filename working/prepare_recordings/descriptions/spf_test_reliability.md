# TEST_RELIABILITY

## Synthetic groundtruth generated by spikeforest
- Data generated by James Jun on May 23, 2019 based on a simulated study (`synth_magland\datasets_noise20_K20_C8`).
- Smaller random normal noise is added to the raw traces (5 uVrms) to test for the reproducibility of spike sorting algorithms.
- Random seed was varied 30 times per study, and there are 10 studies in this studyset.
- The dataset is generated using IronClust matlab script available on github
  - https://github.com/jamesjun/ironclust/tree/master/matlab/convert_mda/convert_mda_reliability_
  - run `irc convert-mda-reliability` after installing `IronClust`
- All recordings contain 20 ground-truth units, 8 channels, 600 s recording duration, and 20.62 uVrms noise.
