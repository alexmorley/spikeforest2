# SYNTH_VISAPY

## Synthetic groundtruth generated by ViSAPy

- Data converted to the mda format by James Jun on Feb 19, 2019.
- Data provided by Peter Lee from Paninski lab (used to test YASS).
- "ViSAPy" is a NEURON-based simulator developed by Espen Hagen from Einevoll's group.

## Recording format

- The directory contains six recordings (set1..6)
- Each recording contains 30 channels, 300 sec duration
- Data is stored in float32 format
- Unit is in millivolts, and spikes have negative polarity
- Each recording contains 16 ground truth units
