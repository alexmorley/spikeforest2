# SPF_MANUAL_FRANKLAB

- Tetrode manual sorting by three human sorters. Dataset prepared by Jason Chung from Loren Frank's lab.
- Three human sorters sorted identical recordings, and the data is divided to three time durations (600s, 1200s, 2400s).
- Prepared by James Jun (2018 Dec 21).

## Studies contained
- `manual_tetrode_2400s` (3 recordings)
  - Each recording is 2400s long (full duration). 
- `manual_tetrode_1200s` (6 recordings)
  - Each recording is split into two 1200s segments. 
- `manual_tetrode_600s` (12 recordings)
  - Each recording is split into two 600s segments.
