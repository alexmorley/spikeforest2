# SPF_MANUAL_FRANKLAB

Tetrode manual sorting by three human sorters. Dataset prepared by Jason Chung from Loren Frank's lab.

## Studies

* manual_tetrode_2400s (3 recordings)
  - Each recording is 2400s long (full duration). 
* manual_tetrode_1200s (6 recordings)
  - Each recording is split into two 1200s segments. 
* manual_tetrode_600s (12 recordings)
  - Each recording is split into two 600s segments. 

Note that the 3 recordings are all the same, but sorted by different people.
