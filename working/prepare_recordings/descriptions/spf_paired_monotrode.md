# PAIRED_MONOTRODE
- Raw recordings were curated by James Jun
- For each original paired recordings, four channels with the highest peak-to-peak voltages were extracted and saved to individual files.

## Electrodes
- Monotrode (single-channel electrode) by subsampling the paired intra/extracellular recordings collected by four labs
  Adam Kampff (UCL), Ed Boyden (MIT), Gyuri Buszaki (NYU), Olivier Marre (CNRS)
