 #spikeforest #forestview

Added aggregated sorting results table view to forest view. This shows an accuracy table similar to the main table on the spike-front website. Right now the accuracy threshold is hard-coded at 80%.

Updated sorter names in analysis files (e.g., MountainSort4-thr3 => MountainSort4)

It is now easier to launch forestview from a notebook. For example (as of spikeforest v0.5.6):

```
from forestview import forestview
from mountainclient import client as mt

path = 'key://pairio/spikeforest/spikeforest_analysis_results.visapy_mea.json'
mt.configDownloadFrom('kbucket')
forestview(path)
```
