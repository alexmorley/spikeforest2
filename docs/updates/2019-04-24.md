 #spikeforest #forestview

Added aggregated sorting results table view to forest view. This shows an accuracy table similar to the main table on the spike-front website.

Updated sorter names in analysis files (e.g., MountainSort4-thr3 => MountainSort4)

It is now easier to launch forestview from a notebook. For example (as of spikeforest v0.5.7, mountaintools v0.2.7):

```
from forestview import forestview
from mountainclient import client as mt

path = 'key://pairio/spikeforest/spikeforest_analysis_results.visapy_mea.json'
mt.configDownloadFrom('kbucket')
forestview(path)
```

Renamed kb-sync -> kb-download (note: need to use --download-from for kb-download)

Added kb-find command

Allow aliases in upload_to and download_from strings. For example: --download-from spikeforest.kbucket

Implemented parameter ranges in analysis.*.json files. For example, see working/main_analysis/analysis.test_range.json
It includes the following sorter that ranges over two parameters (detect_sign and adjacency_radius):

```
"ms4-rng": {
    "name": "MountainSort4",
    "processor_name": "MountainSort4",
    "params": {
        "detect_sign": {"_list": [-1, 0, 1]},
        "adjacency_radius": {"_range": [45, 56, 5]},
        "detect_threshold": 3
    },
    "compute_resource": "cpu"
},
```
