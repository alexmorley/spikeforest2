 #spikeforest #cleanup

SpikeExtractors and SpikeToolkit dependencies have continued to cause some problems, so to avoid future pitfalls, I have deleted spikeforest.spikeextractors and spikeforest.spiketoolkit (we had mostly moved away from those anyway). I have updated / cleaned up the whole repo... and the unit tests passed. I have also updated the notebooks.

Made vdomr components more robust and updated elec geom widget

The vdomr plotly component is now much smoother (e.g., the cluster view). The resizing works much better.
