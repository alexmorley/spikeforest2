 #forestview #analysis

I added some prelim views for opening an analysis in forestview. So you can do:

```
cd working/main_analysis
forestview --mode analysis analysis.visapy_mea.json 
```

It's a read-only view of that analysis file. In the future we can enabling editing and even launching, and viewing the results.

The second update is that I checked in a file called .vscode/snippets/python.json. If you install the "Project Snippets" vscode extension then you can make use of these. The first one I added was to create a new forestview view class. So you just type "forestview-view" and vscode will popup a nice snippet interface where you can type in the name of the class, etc.
