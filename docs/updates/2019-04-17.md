 #forestview

I have made the following improvements to forestview.

* Moveable tabs
* Closeable tabs
* Option to always_open_new -- which defaults to False, so we don't open, e.g., the settings tab more than once. (suggested by Alex M)

It is in a new branch called "forestview2". I'll merge it in once it has been tested.

Also, I solved the race conditions for executing javascript. And now the right way to execute javascript in a vdomr component is to use postRenderScript as well as self.executeJavascript()

Both are guaranteed to happen AFTER the component element gets added to the DOM. And the latter is guaranteed to happen after the postRenderScript. This is important because often you'll try to execute javascript before the thing is actually rendered, so it's important to establish this exec order without making crazy hoops of setTimeout's and checks.
