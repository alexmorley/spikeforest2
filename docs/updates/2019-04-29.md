Systematizing the prepare/analyze/assemble scripts for website

Creating test analyses: working/test_analysis

Debugging kilosort2 wrapper with James

Ran all processing from scratch (using MLPROCESSORS_FORCE_RUN=TRUE)
Total took ~6 hours. Below breakdown of timing

clock time
13:20 started
13:41 finished paired_boyden32c (21 minutes)
14:06 finished paired_crcns (25 minutes)
14:34 finished paired_kampff (28 minutes)
14:48 finished paired_mea64c (14 minutes)
14:55 finished synth_visapy (7 minutes)
15:23 finished synth_magland (28 minutes)
15:48 finished synth_mearec_tetrode (25 minutes)
16:02 finished manual_franklab (14 minutes)
17:37 finished synth_bionet (95 minutes)
19:10 finished synth_mearec_neuronexus (93 minutes)

This was excluding KiloSort2 (as well as SC for some)
Except: accidentally did not exclude ks2 from synth_mearec_neuronexus -- may that's why it took especially long
Note: ks2 not working at present

Subsequent (cached) run of all processing takes ~3 minutes.
