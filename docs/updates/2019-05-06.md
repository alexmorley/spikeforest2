 #spikeforest #kachery

 New functionality allows restricting access to kachery nodes for both upload and download. For example, put the following in 
`~/.mountaintools/kachery_tokens`
```
spikeforest.kbucket download **********
spikeforest.kbucket upload **********
```
and the following can be removed as it is deprecated:
`~/.mountaintools/kachery_upload_tokens`

Implemented cpu heatmap chart for website

Refactoring to depend on 0.4.2 of SpikeExtractors
